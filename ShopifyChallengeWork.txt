A)
I used:
SELECT ShipperID FROM Shippers
WHERE ShipperName='Speedy Express'

To figure out I needed ShipperID = 1. Then, I used the following for the solution

SELECT COUNT(OrderID) FROM Orders
WHERE ShipperID=1;

B)

I used the following query to find which employee had the most orders:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders
Where EmployeeID=x;

Using this, I varied x between 1 and 9, and observed that Employee 4 had the most orders (40)
Then, I used EmployeeID=4 to find their last name:

SELECT LastName FROM Employees
WHERE EmployeeID=4;

Which is Peacock. The employee's name is Margaret Peacock

C)

First, I found all of the German customers using the following:

SELECT CustomerID FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'

That yielded the following values:
CustomerID: [1, 6, 17, 25, 39, 44, 52, 56, 63, 79, 86]

Those CustomerID's were responsible for the following orders:

11111
10267
10273
10277
10279
10284
10285
10286
10301
10312
10313
10337
10342
10343
10345
10348
10356
10361
10363
10366
10391
10396
10407
10418
10426
10438

I used a query that returned the order details from these orders. Then, I added up which product had the highest sum
quantity ordered. That product is product #40: Boston Crab Meat


SELECT ProductName FROM Products
WHERE ProductID=40
